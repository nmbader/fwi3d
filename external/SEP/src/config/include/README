SEP's laboratory-wide standard rules 
for reproducible electronic documents

				
These rules are adapted to SEP's compute environment. 
docs/Rules contains a more generic version.

  SUMMARY 

To organize computational scientific research 
and hence to conveniently transfer our technology,
we impose a simple filing discipline on the authors in our laboratory.
A document's makefile includes laboratory-wide standard rules
that offer readers these four standard commands:
   make burn  removes the document's result figures, 
   make build  recomputes them, 
   make view  displays the figures, and 
   make clean  removes any intermediate files.
Although we developed these standards to aid readers
we discovered that authors are often the principal beneficiaries.


Contents:

 o Doc files:	implements SEP's make rules and variable definitions 
		for SEP's electronic reproducible documents.

 o Prg files: 	implements SEP's make rules and variable definitions for 
		compiling, linking, and installation of executables.

 o SEP files:	organizes the inclusion of the various make source code.

 o Adm dir: 	contains administrative files 

 o docs dir: 	contains the documentation for SEP's reproducible research
		system.


 o docs/cip dir: 	contains our white paper on reproducible electronic
			documents (if you want to find out what it is all
			about start here).

 o docs/Rules dir: 	contains a generic set of rules for reproducible
			electronic documents.

 o docs/Frog dir: 	contains a generic example of a reproducible
			electronic document.

 o docs/index file:	offers our reproducible research software on the
			World Wide Web.

 o docs/sephelp dir: 	describes the SEP specific rules for reproducible
			document (not yet in great shape).

 o docs/cake.ps: 	discusses an earlier implementation of our reproducible
			electronic document.

 o docs/seg92.html:	reports on our first reproducible electronic document
			efforts to the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

 o docs/blurb.html:	reports to SEP's sponsors on our progress in various
			technology areas, such as reproducible electronic 
			documents.

 o docs/cdvswww.html: 	expresses SEP's disappointment delivering reproducible
			research using CD-ROM technology for UNIX workstations.


To Do List: 

 o Matt: we need SEP.shell.rules that implements 
	cross platform installations (as in our/word/Adm/Src ...)

 o Matt: {\it every} document level (book, chapter, figure level) should
	offer the same standard commands  (clean,burn,build,view).
	Book level is missing. Chapter level should be automatically
	up dated. 

 o Matt: How to extract single chapters (for web distribution)?
