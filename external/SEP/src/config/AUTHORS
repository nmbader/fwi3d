Probably most SEP researcher have contributed in some way to SEPlib.
However, some researchers stand out:

  Robert Clayton introduced the original parameter fetching
    and did much ground breaking work concerning Vplot.

  Jon Claerbout introduced history files.

  Dave Hale wrote the libvplot library.

  Stew Levin got SEPlib pipes to work and ported Vplot to DEC Gigi
    terminals.

  Joe Dellinger perfected Vplot, the graphics library.

  Steve Cole added dithering of rasterplots to Vplot.


  Dave Nichols reworked the SEPlib input and output handling and introduced
    GNUmakefiles for easy installation.

  Martin Karrenbach had a first SEPlib extension to handle irregular data.

  Biondo Biondi and Bob Clapp (with the help of current SEP students)
    truly extended SEPlib to handle irregular data.
